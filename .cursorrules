# Qlik Project Rules

## Qlik Script Files (.qvs)
When working with any file that has the `.qvs` extension, you MUST:
- Use ONLY QlikView/Qlik Sense script syntax
- Follow Qlik script conventions and best practices
- Use proper Qlik functions (e.g., Load, Select, Where, Join, etc.)
- Use semicolons (;) to terminate statements
- Use proper Qlik data types and field naming conventions
- Do NOT use SQL syntax, Python syntax, or any other programming language syntax
- Do NOT use SQL keywords like SELECT, FROM, WHERE (use Qlik equivalents: Load, From, Where)
- Use Qlik-specific functions like Chr(), RecNo(), Pick(), Round(), Rand(), etc.
- Follow Qlik script structure with table names followed by colons (e.g., `TableName:`)
- Indent all statements with the same width
- **CRITICAL FORMATTING**: In Load statements, align all `as` keywords at the same column position, regardless of field name/expression length. Use appropriate spacing so that `as` keywords are vertically aligned.


## Examples of Correct Qlik Syntax:
- `Load * From [file.qvd];`
- `Load Field1, Field2 as Alias From Table;`
- `Where Condition = 'Value';`
- `Join (Table) Load * From [file.qvd];`

## Examples of INCORRECT Syntax (DO NOT USE):
- SQL: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;`
- Python: `import pandas; df = pd.read_csv()`
- Any other non-Qlik syntax

## Example of CORRECT Indentation and Alignment
Load
    'long string value'    as DATA,
    short                  as DATA2,
    today()                as DATE,
    malmö                  as CITY
From
    [lib://DataSource/data.qvd](qvd)
;

Note: All `as` keywords must be aligned at the same column position, even when field expressions have different lengths.



When editing or creating `.qvs` files, always validate that the syntax is valid Qlik script syntax.
